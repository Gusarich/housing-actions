# housing-actions
We're developing a standard for Housing Developers to implement Housing's actions system into their projects easily!

> [!TIP]
> If you're planning on starting a project using Housing-Actions, you should wait a bit.
> This is because we're currently still **in heavy development**. If you wanna help, open pulls & issues!

## FAQ
* Where is this format from?
    * We based it on a decrypted version of Housing's actions stored in Item NBTs.
    * We have made changes like using booleans instead of 0 or 1, and improving consistency in key names.
